    For a brief period, I pursued engineering at PVGCOET, Pune, where I obtained a B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication in November 2020. 
    
    In January 2021, I joined the Data Analytics Team at Tayana Mobility Technologies in Bangalore as a Data Analyst. This role exposed me to data management and data lakehouse architecture, allowing me to gain essential skills in Python, Perl, Bash, SQL, and Tableau. Those three years were invaluable, providing practical experience in the retail sector and strengthening my leadership and teamwork abilities. 
    
    In Fall 2023, I began my MSc in Data Science at the University of Bath, which I completed in September 2024, further enriching my expertise.

But that's where the magic happens. We've learned to thrive in this fast-paced environment, and ait has taught me the critical importance of getting it right the first time. It has taught me to stay detail-oriented and keep my cool, even when I feel like I'm in the spotlight. We've turned that pressure into a kind of energy that pushes us to be quicker and more efficient. It's pretty satisfying when you nail a rush of orders and see the pleased looks on customers. I have picked up so many skills here - multitasking like a pro, keeping calm when things get crazy, and always bringing my A-game to teamwork. Plus, my people skills have gone through the roof. The coolest thing is knowing these are not just restaurant skills. Being reliable, detail-focused, and great with people? These skills are gold in any job. Leon has been like a boot camp for skills that will set me up no matter where I go next."
