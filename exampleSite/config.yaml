    content: |-
      I am currently pursuing an MSc in Data Science at the University of Bath. Earlier, I worked as a Data Analyst at Tayana Mobility Technologies, where I worked on Data Integration, Data Manipulation and Data Warehousing along with Reporting and Data Visualisation. Prior, I graduated as an Electronics and Telecommunication Engineer in the year 2020 from the Svaitribai Phule Pune University, India.

      Outside of my academic and professional life, I enjoy exploring cities, discovering new restaurants and cafes, and staying active with sports and fitness. With everlasting interest in technology and the arts, recently I find peace in cooking and research.

      Lastly, I am always keen to connect with fellow professionals, data enthusiasts, and anyone passionate about harnessing the power of data. Let's explore the endless possibilities together!

        content: "Working at Leon has been an incredible learning experience. On any given day, we are juggling multiple orders while customers watch us closely - talk about pressure! But that's where the magic happens. We've learned to thrive in this fast-paced environment, and ait has taught me the critical importance of getting it right the first time. It has taught me to stay detail-oriented and keep my cool, even when I feel like I'm in the spotlight. We've turned that pressure into a kind of energy that pushes us to be quicker and more efficient. It's pretty satisfying when you nail a rush of orders and see the pleased looks on customers. I have picked up so many skills here - multitasking like a pro, keeping calm when things get crazy, and always bringing my A-game to teamwork. Plus, my people skills have gone through the roof. The coolest thing is knowing these are not just restaurant skills. Being reliable, detail-focused, and great with people? These skills are gold in any job. Leon has been like a boot camp for skills that will set me up no matter where I go next."
